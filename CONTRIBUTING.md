For now, I, What42, have completely control over everything regarding this version of the standard and specification and RomVer. You can make suggestions and point out problems, but everything has to be approved by me and me alone. It is set up this way only because of how unknown and uneventful RomVer currently is, but if it gains attraction and popularity then I can switch this to a more democratic governing model.
