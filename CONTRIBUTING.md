For now, I, What42, have completely control over everything regarding this standard and specification of RomVer. You can make suggestions and point out problems, but everything has to be approved by me and me alone. This is only because of how unknown and unseen RomVer currently is, but if it gains attraction and popularity then I can switch this over to a more democratic governing model.
